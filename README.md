💥 Unlock Operation Insights – Analyze Supply Chain Data! [Refined and Enhanced]
Understanding supply chain operations and sales performance is key to optimizing business operations and driving revenue growth. By analyzing key metrics such as revenue, profit, delivery time, return rates, and customer behavior, I have drawn valuable insights to support strategic decision making. After receiving valuable feedback, I continued to improve and upgrade the supply chain analysis project to provide a more in-depth and intuitive perspective:
✅ Add slicers to help filter data more flexibly and intuitively
✅ Add a navigation panel to easily navigate between analysis pages
✅ Optimize the overall layout, ensuring a smooth and professional user experience
✅ Fine-tune each chart to convey the right message, serving a clear purpose for each dashboard page
I would like to sincerely thank Mr. Hieu Nguyen Trung (Maz), Mr. Tô Trọng Kiên, and Ms. Phuong Vu for their invaluable feedback, which greatly contributed to the completion of this final product.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6342fa3a-e85b-48e1-8279-98c6c0a26ed7)
